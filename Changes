Revision history for Perl module Java::JVM::Classfile

0.17 Tue Apr 16 16:25:43 GMT 2002
	- support for int type
	- support for sipush opcode
	- new spin and fibo tests

0.16 Sat Dec 15 15:57:06 GMT 2001
	- added support for iinc, newarray opcodes
	- new Java::JVM::Classfile::Perl which converts JVM
	instructions to Perl code (with major limitations of course,
	try ./class2perl.pl Bench.class). Can only pass in one argument to
	subroutines at the moment, and probably need to write the
	whole of the Java class libraries in Perl...

0.15 Thu Oct 25 11:39:05 BST 2001
	- much more robust bytecode parser which parses more bytecodes
	and copes with branches and labels (new Bench.class and bench.t)
	- support for LineNumberTable attribute (and docs & tests)

0.14 Thu Oct 18 19:10:13 BST 2001
	- added bytecode parser (see Code attribute)

0.12 Mon Oct  8 12:22:43 BST 2001
	- created and released first version
